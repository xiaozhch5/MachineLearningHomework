# problem description
* Generate n = 2,000 points uniformly at random in the two-dimensional unit square. Which point do you expect the centroid to be?
* What objective does the centroid of the points optimize?
* Apply gradient descent (GD) to find the centroid.
* Apply stochastic gradient descent (SGD) to find the centroid. Can you say in simple words, what the algorithm is doing?

In mathematics and physics, the centroid or geometric center of a plane figure is the arithmetic mean position of all the points in the figure. Informally, it is the point at which a cutout of the shape could be perfectly balanced on the tip of a pin.
